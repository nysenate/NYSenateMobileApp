Today we are releasing the beta version of the New York State Senate mobile app. This is the first mobile app released by a State Legislature. This app brings the functionality of the NYSenate.gov site and the Open Legislation service to users on the go, no matter where they are. From finding your Senator using your current GPS location, to searching legislation or session transcripts, to watching Senate session video from just hours ago, citizens of New York State are now just a tap away from their legislature.

----------------------------------

This application was developed using the Appcelerator Titanium framework which can be downloaded here: http://appcelerator.com/

Titanium is a cross-platform Javascript-to-Native binding approach to mobile development, which produces highly usable, well performing native mobile applications from one central Javascript application source source. The Javascript code is fully compliant, standards-based scripting, though the application APIs are proprietary to the Titanium platform. However, Appcelerator has open-sourced their code base, which was sufficient for us to choose their platform on which to build our application.

We are also big supporters of pure HTML5+CSS mobile applications, but for now, this is the approach we have taken, and we hope you find value in our source code.
